## Introduction

This is for our senior capstone project, which is designed to improve the energy efficiency and performance of the West Virginia University's Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) System. The main focus of this project is to collect data regarding the energy consumption of the PRT. Additional sensors are to be added to measure the GPS location and temperature. These sensors will collect real time information, which can then be studied and analyzed to detect patterns that may be useful for improving the functionality of the PRT system. 

Our implementation this semester focused on creating a server and client and a database to store the collected datapoints. The server and client are designed to be extensible so that more of these sensors and Pis can be added to the system in the future. 


## EDIT THIS!!! ADD HOW TO RUN SECTION HERE
EDIT -- put the terminal commands inside triple ticks to make the blocks
The double hashtags make a smaller header, Single hashtags make the big main headers

```

## How to run our MPX

```bash
 cd FunGroupName
./mpx.sh
```

EDIT -- add links here for future ref. GITHUB, local host numbers ????? 

The client and server Java code will be located in this Github repository.
